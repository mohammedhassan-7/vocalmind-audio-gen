## Dialog

```
[T02] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Thank you for calling NexaLink Telecommunications Broadband and Support. My name is Marcus. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?"
```

```
[T03] CUSTOMER | tired:3 | slow | mid | normal | (sigh)
"Hi, my name is Sofia Reyes. I'm having problems with my internet — it's very, very slow."
```

```
[T04] AGENT | empathetic:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Hi, Sofia, I'm sorry to hear that. I understand you're calling about slow internet, and I can definitely help you with that. First, I just need to verify a few things on the account. Could you confirm your full account number for me?"
```

```
[T05] CUSTOMER | cooperative:2 | slow | mid | normal
"Yes. It is seven-seven-nine-zero, three-three-two-two, one-five."
```

```
[T06] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal | (typing)
"Got it. Could you confirm the last four digits of the payment method we have on file?"
```

```
[T07] CUSTOMER | uncertain:2 | slow | mid | normal | (pause)
"Um, I think it's the credit card? Last four is two-six-five-five."
```

```
[T08] AGENT | reassuring:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Perfect, that matches. And one more — could you tell me the last four digits of your social security or national ID, or the security PIN, whichever is easier?"
```

```
[T09] CUSTOMER | cooperative:2 | normal | mid | normal
"The security PIN is one-zero-zero-eight."
```

```
[T10] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Wonderful. Sofia, you're fully verified. Thanks for being patient with that."
```

```
[T11] CUSTOMER | calm:2 | normal | mid | normal
"No problem."
```

```
[T12] AGENT | empathetic:3 | normal | mid | normal
"So I want to acknowledge — slow internet is honestly one of the most frustrating things, especially when you're trying to actually get something done. Let me ask a few quick questions so we can figure out exactly what's happening, okay?"
```

```
[T13] CUSTOMER | cooperative:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Yes, please."
```

```
[T14] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"First — is this your home internet, or are you having mobile data issues?"
```

```
[T15] CUSTOMER | calm:2 | normal | mid | normal
"Home internet. The WiFi."
```

```
[T16] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Got it. Is the slow speed affecting all of your devices, or just one?"
```

```
[T17] CUSTOMER | thoughtful:2 | slow | mid | normal | (pause)
"All of them, I think. My laptop, my phone, the smart TV. Everything is slow."
```

```
[T18] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Okay, that's helpful. And was it sudden — like one day it just changed — or has it been getting slower over time?"
```

```
[T19] CUSTOMER | thoughtful:2 | slow | mid | normal
"It started maybe four days ago. Suddenly. Before that it was fine."
```

```
[T20] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Perfect. Thank you. Has anything changed in the home recently — new device, a router move, a power outage?"
```

```
[T21] CUSTOMER | thoughtful:3 | slow | mid | normal
"Hmm. There was a small power flicker last week. The lights blinked. Maybe Wednesday?"
```

```
[T22] AGENT | curious:3 | normal | mid | normal
"That's a useful clue. Let me first check that there's no outage in your area. One moment."
```

```
[T23] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal | (typing)
"Okay — your account is active, no billing holds, and there are no reported outages in your service area. So this looks like a local issue we can troubleshoot together. Are you near your modem and router right now?"
```

```
[T24] CUSTOMER | calm:2 | normal | mid | normal
"Yes, I am sitting next to it."
```

```
[T25] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Wonderful. The first thing I'd like to do is run a speed test, but I need it to be accurate — so I need you to plug your laptop directly into the modem with an ethernet cable, if you have one. WiFi tests aren't precise enough for this."
```

```
[T26] CUSTOMER | uncertain:2 | slow | mid | normal | (pause)
"Ethernet cable… one moment, let me check… yes, I have one. Hold on, I will plug it in."
```

```
[T27] AGENT | reassuring:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Take your time, Sofia."
```

```
[T28] CUSTOMER | concentrating:2 | slow | mid | quiet
"Okay… plugging in now…"
```

```
[T29] CUSTOMER | calm:2 | normal | mid | normal
"Okay, it is plugged in."
```

```
[T30] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Great. Now please open a browser and go to nexalink dot speedtest. When the page loads, click the big start button and read me the download number when it finishes."
```

```
[T31] CUSTOMER | concentrating:2 | slow | mid | normal
"Okay… loading… clicking start now…"
```

```
[T32] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal | (pause)
"I'm still here with you, Sofia — just waiting for the result. Thank you for your patience."
```

```
[T33] CUSTOMER | concerned:3 | normal | mid | normal
"It says… download is twenty-eight Mbps."
```

```
[T34] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"And which plan are you on — do you remember? Looking here, I see you're on the two hundred Mbps fiber plan."
```

```
[T35] CUSTOMER | surprised:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Two hundred? But I'm getting twenty-eight? That's like ten percent."
```

```
[T36] AGENT | empathetic:3 | normal | mid | normal
"That's a real problem. You should be seeing close to two hundred on a wired test. Let me have you do a couple of things. How many devices are connected to your WiFi right now? Anything downloading or backing up?"
```

```
[T37] CUSTOMER | thoughtful:2 | slow | mid | normal
"Maybe… seven devices? But nothing is downloading. The TV is off."
```

```
[T38] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Okay. Seven is normal — that's not the cause. The fact that the wired speed is this low points to the modem itself. I'd like to power-cycle it. That means unplugging the power cable from the back of the modem, waiting a full thirty seconds, and plugging it back in. Can you do that?"
```

```
[T39] CUSTOMER | cooperative:2 | normal | mid | normal
"Yes. Unplugging now."
```

```
[T40] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Thirty seconds. I'll count with you if you'd like, or you can just plug it back in when you're ready. The lights on the front will start blinking — that's normal. Wait until they go solid before we test again. That usually takes one to two minutes."
```

```
[T41] CUSTOMER | calm:2 | slow | mid | normal | (pause)
"Okay… plugged in… the lights are blinking now."
```

```
[T42] AGENT | reassuring:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Perfect. Let's give it a moment. While we wait — that power flicker you mentioned last Wednesday is most likely what caused this. The modem can hang in a degraded state after a brief power loss. The full power-cycle is what fixes it."
```

```
[T43] CUSTOMER | curious:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Oh, interesting. So a small flicker can do this?"
```

```
[T44] AGENT | warm:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Surprisingly, yes — the modem doesn't always recover automatically. Are the lights solid yet?"
```

```
[T45] CUSTOMER | cooperative:2 | normal | mid | normal
"Yes, they are solid now. Green and white."
```

```
[T46] AGENT | professional:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Wonderful. Now let's run the speed test one more time on the wired connection."
```

```
[T47] CUSTOMER | curious:3 | normal | mid | normal | (pause)
"Okay… running it… "
```

```
[T48] CUSTOMER | relieved:4 | normal | high | normal
"Oh! Two hundred and twelve Mbps! It's working!"
```

```
[T49] AGENT | warm:4 | normal | mid | normal
"There we go! That's right where you should be. So just to summarize what happened — the brief power flicker last week left the modem in a degraded state, the full thirty-second power cycle reset its connection to the network, and you're now getting full speed. Does that all make sense?"
```

```
[T50] CUSTOMER | grateful:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Yes, it makes sense. Thank you so much, Marcus. I was thinking I would have to buy a new router."
```

```
[T51] AGENT | warm:3 | normal | mid | normal
"No, your equipment is fine. And just so you know for the future — if you ever see speeds drop suddenly again, the very first thing to try is that thirty-second power cycle. If it ever doesn't fix it, give us a call right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sofia?"
```

```
[T52] CUSTOMER | satisfied:3 | normal | mid | normal
"No, that is all. You were very helpful."
```

```
[T53] AGENT | warm:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Thank you for saying that. Your case reference number for today is N-X-L dash four-four-eight-zero-three-six-six. After we hang up, you'll get a quick survey — if you have a moment, your feedback really helps us."
```

```
[T54] CUSTOMER | warm:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Of course. Goodbye, Marcus."
```

```
[T55] AGENT | warm:3 | normal | mid | normal
"Have a wonderful day, Sofia."
